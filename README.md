## Project Description

A quiz based off the silly buzzfeed quizzes you see all the time. It's a personality quiz based off personal choices/interests and you have to choose which option you prefer the most. The screen will change to the next with the help of an arrow key or a next button at the bottom of the screen when pressed, all the options will be functional, and the users choices are tallied and results are given at the end.
